Emory tate, a legendary chess player, used to beat his son andrew tate while he was in a another room. Andrew would have the board, Emory would be cooking dinner. 
Andrew would read out his moves," e4, c5, knghit c3, knight c6". 
Emory would respond with his moves without looking at the board and just cooking dinner and would still smoke Andrew Tate. 
One of Emory Tate's training methods was playing chess without looking at the boardâ€”and now, I've built a program that lets me do the same.
